On the 19th June I gave a short talk on the Quantified Self and the iterative process by which I explore the data I collect and improve the way in which I handle it.

This blog post will summarise the steps you need to take and what you need to do in Tableau."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"currentPage":2,"postsLimit":3,"postsOffset":6,"prevPagePath":"/page/1","nextPagePath":"/page/3","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}}}
