Workflow was acquired by Apple and is now called Siri Shortcuts and is Free on the App Store.</p>\n<p>The challenge behind data collection</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’ve collected data about yourself or have briefly interacted with others who are part of the quantified self movement, the very first challenge or question posed always revolves around data collection and data manipulation and following that, analysis. For the last few years, I’ve <a href=\"http://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/accenture-quantified-self\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">proved many times that the analysis is easiest and best done in Tableau</a>. It allows me to analyse and ask questions as fast as I can think of them and better yet, it allows me to then present those findings in new and engaging ways and I’ve done that with music, <a href=\"http://tableautim.com//apple-watch-4-things-ive-learnt-whilst-working-with-its-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">heart rate data</a> and <a href=\"http://tableautim.com//barcelona-marathon-2016-route-scout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">marathon data</a> , or my whereabouts <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/MovementsthroughLondonMovesApp/London?:embed=y&#x26;:display%5C_count=yes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">as shown here</a>“.</p>\n<p>Ellie</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ellie is my car, nicknamed after the first two letters of the registration plate. I’ve owned her for just over 9 years and like most cars this age, you have to stay on top of maintenance to avoid nasty shocks. In April, I took her in for a service and the summary of the visit was that mileage was having an impact on wear and a tear and performance had dropped. A couple of the key things they said to watch out for was fuel consumption and mileage and essentially checking certain parts and items on the car on a schedule set by mileage rather than time and so I set out to track mileage and fuel consumption manually.</p>\n<p>Trial and error</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started with a Google form, it was super tedious, not much more to say about this, I gave up after 2 trips to the fuel station. I tried <a href=\"http://www.reporter-app.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Reporter app</a> but that carried the overhead of always life logging at the fuel pump which in itself started to skew my data with more representations of fuel stations rather than the random sampling that reporter tends to operate by. It also didn’t collect this data too well. My final resort was to keep the receipt and at the end of the month type it all out and clock the mileage weekly, this caused other issues, I’d forget or loose receipts, I just wasn’t organised enough to do this.</p>\n<p>The solution</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After a lot of frustration I downloaded a an expense tracker that allowed me to track fuel and I essentially used this app (targeted more at the accounting and expenses world) to log this one thing but even then I missed vital information. I needed a way to track this data at the fuel court, within 10 seconds using the intelligence of my phone and convenience to capture the date, grab some context and save it somewhere. Three months back, within a week of each other Tableau and Workflow introduced the ability to connect to and post to Google sheets respectively. I use Workflow extensively for plugging all the gaps in iOS or my social media sharing and also used it to script my way out of annoying limitations of the platform. I won’t go into workflow now <a href=\"http://www.imore.com/how-use-workflow-ios-when-you-dont-know-where-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">but this post here is a pretty solid </a> (there’s <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/tag/workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">way more here</a> if you blast through that) and the images below give an indication of what workflows I’ve built within it and how the fuel tracker I built in it looks like in development. If you’ve used Alteryx, you’ll get workflow straight away. So this short clip below is what my fuel logging now looks like and of course, if you’ve used Tableau you’ll know that analysis is super easy.</p>\n<p>… and then analysis in Tableau.</p>\n<hr>","fields":{"slug":"ad-hoc-data-collection-for-tableau-analysis","tagSlugs":["/tag/quantified-self/","/tag/tableau/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-10-26T22:40:32.169Z","description":"In this post, find out how to maintain some clarity and focus in your dashboard designs using three really simple techniques to make sure you build something functional and clear.","tags":["Quantified Self","Tableau"],"title":"Ad-hoc data collection for Tableau analysis: Quantified self, Workflow & Google Sheets","socialImage":"/media/gutenberg.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"ad-hoc-data-collection-for-tableau-analysis"}}}
