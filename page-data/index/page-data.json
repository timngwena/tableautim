In the talk I showed in 5 minutes how you could get hold of the location data that Google has in a JSON format and  then very quickly visualise it in Tableau. This blog post will summarise the steps you need to take and what you need to do in Tableau."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/tabtqs-week-1-rescue-time/","categorySlug":"/category/blog/","tagSlugs":["/tag/alteryx/","/tag/quantified-self/","/tag/tableau/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"#tabtQS 1: RescueTime in Tableau","date":"2017-03-14T22:40:32.169Z","category":"Blog","tags":["Alteryx","Quantified Self","Tableau"],"description":"Leading up to several talks I'll be giving in April, I'm going to do a series of mini posts highlighting the process behind the quantified self workflows that I use.

That said the idea / look wasn't original.
