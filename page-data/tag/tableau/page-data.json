In the talk I showed in 5 minutes how you could get hold of the location data that Google has in a JSON format and  then very quickly visualise it in Tableau.

That said the idea / look wasn't original. I struggled finding an angle so I took to my viz library and settled on a design by Nicholas Felton.  Whilst the data he used was different, the visual communication style suited the data and I also saw a challenge in trying to recreate that style in Tableau.
