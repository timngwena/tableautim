On the 19th June I gave a short talk on the Quantified Self and the iterative process by which I explore the data I collect and improve the way in which I handle it. In the talk I showed in 5 minutes how you could get hold of the location data that Google has in a JSON format and Â then very quickly visualise it in Tableau. This blog post will summarise the steps you need to take and what you need to do in Tableau."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/tabtqs-week-1-rescue-time/","categorySlug":"/category/blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"#tabtQS 1: RescueTime in Tableau","date":"2017-03-14T22:40:32.169Z","category":"Blog","description":"Leading up to several talks I'll be giving in April, I'm going to do a series of mini posts highlighting the process behind the quantified self workflows that I use.
